# The Adapter Pattern

The adapter pattern is used for solving incompatibility or for connecting one object to another. The adapter pattern allows different classes that would other wise be incompatible to work together while hiding the complexity of the conversion of the object it's wrapping. 

This design pattern is quite common and quite easy to understand as we have many real world examples of this already. The best real world analogy I found is a travel adapter one would buy if they were to travel from Ireland to the US or to Europe. If we try to charge our phones with our Irish plug/socket in Europe we need an adapter to connect it to the wall. Similarly, an adapter object wraps one object and makes it compatible with another.
