# Builder Pattern

The builder pattern allows you construct complex objects at a step by step process. Like a process of building a house, this pattern lets you produce different kinds of objects at a sequence while still using the same construction code. 
In this example, a clothing item report is being constructed and built. There are different types of product objects, different types of building processes, as well as a Director class for construction.
