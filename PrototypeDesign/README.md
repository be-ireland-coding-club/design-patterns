# Prototype Pattern

The prototype pattern is used as to create duplicate (or clone) objects without making your code dependent on their classes. 
This involves implementing a common "prototype" interface, which creates a clone of the current object. This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly. For example, an object is to be created after a costly database operation. In this example, the prototype pattern is demonstrated with cloning Flowers: as a Shallow copy and a Deep copy.
